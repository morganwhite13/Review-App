# Review-App
A native iOS review application built in Swift that allows a reviewer to create, edit, and publish reviews of movies, TV shows, games, and other entertainment. Users can browse reviews with ratings, images, and detailed commentary, while the reviewer maintains editorial control through a secure sign-in system.
